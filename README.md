### Sale Overview

Looking at the Year-on-Year sales and profit, it is worthy to note that the sales and profit is steadily increasing each year, with the exception of the month of December when there is a slight dip in profit. nevertheless, the forecast look for 2015 look to be very promising, consistent with the trend maintained by the previous years.
Something to take note is the consistent dip in profit and sales every year on the month June to July. 
Diving deeper there is growth in both profit and sales, at least 20% increase each year. 2013 was the best performing year with 32% growth.

### Global Performance

Overall a good sign that majority of the countries is profitable(GREEN) except for a few countries(RED), the Asian Pacific (APAC) took a lead in 29% of global profit , followed closely by EU Market which contributed 25% , the most badly perform market is Canada with only 1.21% , 2 of the profitability country, China and India is part of the APAC , explaining why the market is foremost in term of foremost in profitability. unexpectability, consumer is still the biggest spender compared to  corporate and home office , accounting for over half of profit , except for 47% in the US market 

### Market Performance 

![Market Performance ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74359762/174786126-dc7e27dd-573b-492a-92a3-b85b53218104.png)

Technology seems to be the leading sales in all market. Unsurprising, APAC took the lead in sales, with Canada last, but despite having the lowest profit but the profit margin of 26% put Canada in the lead. This mean that for every dollar earn from sales 26 cents are profit. deeper analysis shows that no discount and low shipping cost is a major factor for the high profit margin, concurrently, despite ranking the highest in discount and shipping, APAC still bring in a substantial amount of profit 

### Customer Analysis

![Customer Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74359762/174795158-31d5802a-38db-4379-8da5-d3e482fbaaa5.png)

Results shows that majority took around 1 quarter before repurchasing, 49% of repurchase was more than the first purchase, display the management strategy to retain existing customer is solid, however the analysis also reveal that there is the lack of new customer since 2011, therefore the management should refocus their priority on enticing new customer, by reducing switching cost or employing penetration pricing strategy as an example. Hypothetically if the company manage to increase their market share, coupled with their effective strategy in retaining customer, this will greatly boost the company profitability in the long term.

### Categorical Analysis

![Catagory analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74359762/174800049-7956238d-4085-439a-b118-0e7deb69131e.png)

A quick look shows that the sales of the categories are almost the same, roughly 30% each. but technology contributed 45% of the total profit. Dissecting profit for each category shows that the copiers and phone is the most profitable, however this does not consider for the material, labour and production supplies, such high profit could be the effect of low cost for assembly and production, but any assumption should only be done with a more comprehensive data  
Analysis reveal that the company earn $34.69 for every piece of copiers sold, while incurring a loss of $0.20 for each piece of table, as such management should prioritise reducing the cost for tables sales or discontinuing the product all together. 
Concurrently binders are heavily discounted. This could be due to the marketing effort to gain more market shares, as such this could be one potential  area the management could focus on to increase profit 

### Further recommendation 

Analysis of the data revealed 3 areas of focus to boost profitability 
1.the company could stop sales in non-profitable countries. At the same time the Canadian market look promising with low shipping cost and high profit to sales ratio, more resources could be allocated to aggressive market themselves and establish more market shares. 
2. the company should prioritise their effort on growing their customer base. With their track record in retaining their customer, this would greatly boost their sales and profitability in the long run.
3.company could explore revenue to reduce shipping cost in the APAC market to boost profit. Strategy such as having a warehouse in the region, or setting up production in the region could have a cost reduction impacting on the shipping cost

### Limitation 
All of the analysis, recommendation and interpretation is based on the data available at the time of the analysis. A more comprehensive data is required, such as assembly and manufacturing cost , would give a deeper insight into the data.
